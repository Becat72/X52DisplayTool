# X52DisplayTool
Front-end gui for HotasCtrl for OS X

X52DisplayTool:

I created this program as a front-end gui for webbasan's exellent HotasCtrl tool for controling the MFD and LED's of a Saitek X52 and X52Pro Hotas Flight Stick.

I use it primarely for updating information on the MFD in Elite: Dangerous, but you can ofcourse use it any way you like :-)

Prerequisites:

- Because this is only a front-end, You must still have java runtime installed, take a look at webbasan's guide for more info.
- You must obviously also have HotasCtrl.jar. You don't need the source code, just the .jarâ€¨

Credits/Links:

- Thanks to Webbasan for his exellent HotasCtrl java tool. Check it out on github at: https://github.com/webbasan/HotasCtrl
- The SaitekX52pro class that webbasan uses was created by Antony T. Curtis in the "Mac Elite: Dangerous" forum. Many thanks to Anthony for this. Check it out on github at: https://github.com/atcurtis/saitekx52pro
